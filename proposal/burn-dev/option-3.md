## Proposal Three: No Token Burn

Instead of a burn this proposal provides more funds to the Ecosystem Fund relative to the other two options. Since there is no burn there is no change in Stake Social's APY. Therefore, the Policy contract is not updated either. This proposal has the lowest circulating supply and inflation rate of all three.
