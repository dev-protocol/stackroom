# Governance Proposal: Burn DEV

## A Fair Launch

Dev Protocol launched the DEV token in the early Summer of 2020. The fair launch was kickstarted with an airdrop to Creators, Open Source Software developers, with no allocations made to investors. Since then the DEV token has been mined by early Patrons supporting
We are expanding the concept of a Fair Launch by allowing Patrons, staking DEV tokens on [Stakes.Social](https://stakes.social), to vote on the DEV tokenâ€™s supply and allocation. There are three proposals for the Dev Protocol community to vote on: 3.5M DEV Burn, 1.5M DEV Burn, and No Burn.

Stakes.Social's APY is calculated based on the Creators onboarded, which produce inflation, and percentage of DEV staked, which lowers inflation. Therefore, if a burn proposal is passed then there will be a higher percentage of DEV stake hence lowering the APY. To counter this, if a burn proposal is chosen then the inflation per Creator will be increased to meet the same APY pre-burn. This will increase the inflation per year for the burn proposals to a negligible amount which will be detailed in each proposal.

## Voting method

[Borda Count](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borda_count) is a single winner election that allows voters to rank their preference. Patrons will receive votes directly proportional to your DEV staked. Voters can rank their preferred allocation from 1 - 3 with 1 being their most preferred allocation. The Borda Count is calculated by multiplying the number of votes obtained by the following coefficients.

| Result | Coefficient |
| ------ | ----------- |
| 1st    | 3           |
| 2nd    | 2           |
| 3rd    | 1           |

## How winner is decided

The Proposal with the highest number of votes at **10 AM UTC on April 6th, 2021** will be determined as the winner.

## How tokens will be burned

Burn the DEV tokens held by the following team wallet. As a result of the burn, the total supply of DEV tokens will be reduced by the same amount as the number burned.
